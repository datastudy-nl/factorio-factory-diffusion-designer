# Factorio Factory Diffusion Model

**Welcome to the Future of Factory Design!**

Factorio Factory Diffusion is an AI-powered model that **automatically generates a fully functional Factorio factory** based on your specified goal! Whether you're optimizing for high throughput, low pollution, or minimal resource consumption, this model will design an efficient, scalable, and production-ready factory in seconds.

## Features
- **Goal-Driven Design** – Just input your factory's goal, and the model will create the optimal layout.
- **Scalable Blueprints** – Generates factories that grow with your needs, from starter bases to megafactories.
- **Optimized for Efficiency** – Utilizes cutting-edge AI techniques to minimize bottlenecks and maximize productivity.
- **Modular & Customizable** – Supports user-defined constraints and preferences for personalized designs.
- **Supports Vanilla & Mods** – Works with both vanilla Factorio and popular mod packs.

## How It Works
1. **Define Your Goal** – Input parameters such as production targets, efficiency constraints, or specific items to produce.
2. **Run the Model** – The AI generates a fully designed factory layout tailored to your goal.
3. **Export & Build** – The generated blueprint can be imported directly into Factorio for implementation.

## Current Status: Closed Beta
Factorio Factory Diffusion is still in development and currently undergoing testing. If you're interested in participating, keep an eye out for **beta invites** and join the journey toward AI-driven factory automation!
